CONTENT

Files of four types of objects: author.txt, conf.txt, paper.txt, term.txt; 
file format: "id \t name" in each line.

Files of three types of link relationships: paper_author.txt, paper_conf.txt, paper_term.txt; 
file format: "id_of_object_type_i \t id_of_object_type_j" in each line denoting two linked objects in type i and type j.

Files of labels: author_label.txt, conf_label.txt, paper_label.txt; 
file format: "id \t label \t name" in each line;
meaning of the labels: 0: Database; 1: Data Mining; 2: AI; 3: Information Retrieval;
